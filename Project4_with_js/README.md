# ðŸŒ™ JavaScript Condition Statement Demo

```javascript
//Condition Statements

let age = 18;
let mode = "dark";

if(mode === "dark") {
    color = "black";
} else {
 color = "white";
}
console.log(color);

âš¡ Ab aapko sirf `README.md` me ye paste karna hai aur ek screenshot (`screenshot.png`) apni repo me dalna hai.  

Kya aap chahte ho ke main console ka **expected output** (like `"black"`) bhi add kar du screenshot ke neeche text form me?
